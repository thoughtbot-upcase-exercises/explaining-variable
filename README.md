# Refactoring / Explaining Variable

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Refactoring](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/refactoring) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

In this exercise, you'll be extracting explaining variables within the `total` method of `Tipper`.

An explaining variable is a variable whose name describes the purpose of the expression you're assigning to it. It's used to help break down longer, more complex expressions, making the final expression more manageable and easier to understand.

    bin/setup

Extract a few new variables whose names explain their purpose.

Make sure the tests are passing by running:

    rake
